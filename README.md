## Branching Strategy
A GitHub Flow Branching strategy will be empleyed throughout the projects done in this semester that will be developed.

The Following Guidelines Apply:<br />
[.] A Main Primery branch where all code will be branching off. This will be the Main Branch.<br />
[.] New Branches will have to be created for buggy code and features that is developed.<br />
[.] When code is reviewed and approved it will then be merged and then committed to the main branch.<br />

## GitIgnore File
To be able to keep certainn information confedential this file will help with ignoring certain files when commiting to the project repositories on GitHub.


## Credential Storage and Sensitive Information
Information containing any and all sensitive information and/or values will only be stored locally as online distrubuters would decrease the confedentiality.
Temperary Files will be used to fill the role for testing purposes when submtting to the Main branch.
